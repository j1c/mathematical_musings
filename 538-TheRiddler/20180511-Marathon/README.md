## Marathon Runner Pairing Problem

The problem is shown [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-hard-is-it-to-find-a-running-buddy/?ex_cid=the-riddler).

The numerical results are shown below. Colors close to off-white mean probabilities closer to one. To summarize, given some value of *s*, or *epsilon*, the probability that each runner has at least one running partner increases as you increase the number of runners. Given some value of *n* runners, the probability that each runner has increases as you increase *s*.
